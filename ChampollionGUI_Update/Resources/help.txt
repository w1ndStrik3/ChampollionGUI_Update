READ THE README BEFORE YOU POST ABOUT AN ISSUE! YOUR QUESTION IS
LIKELY ANSWERED THERE ALREADY!
The README can be found by clicking the README button

If you have trouble and need assistance, please comments on the mod
page on Nexus or post a new issue on the GitHub page. You are welcome
to contact me directly on Steam
https://steamcommunity.com/id/w1ndStrik3_official/, but I would highly
prefer if you would post your issue on Nexus or GitHub, because other
people might have the same issue as you, and find the solution on Nexus
or GitHub. That way I will not 117 people message me about the same
thing. If it so happens that I do not respond within 72 hours of you
writing your post, please contact me on Steam and let me know about
your post. I might not have gotten a notification about your post if I
do not respond within 72 hours. Thank you very much.
