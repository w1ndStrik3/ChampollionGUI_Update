This program is a significant upgrade and modernizations of the
original "Champollion Graphical User Interface" which was originally
made by Arron Dominion. https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/82367

Compared to the old Champollion GUI, this version improves the
performance of the program (this version runs on the newest .NET,
which is .NET version 8 currently). Additionaly, this updated
version of the Champollion Graphical User Interface severely improves
the user experience and the ease of use, along with a few added
features compared to the original version by Arron Dominion.
