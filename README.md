# ChampollionGUI_Update
This tool takes the command line tool options and turns them into an interactive interface for ease of use. Written in C# and requires the original Champollion tool for the actual work.

The update has been uploaded with the approval of Arron Dominion, the creator of the original Champollion GUI tool
Description:
This tool is a graphical user interface designed to make Champollion easier to use.  It does not replace the tool, only takes the command line arguments and converts it into easy form choices.  Was designed and created with C#.  You must have the original tool downloaded for use, as this only provides an interface.

This was created due to seeing how difficult it was for users that have never used Command Prompt and/or any other command line tool in Windows.

# ﻿Updated version:
The original Champollion GUI has been updated to .NET 7.0 and some additional improvements have been made, including the text fields with the ﻿﻿directory paths no longer being read-only, the browse folder function now using the regular file explorer interface along with some other minor ﻿﻿improvements and changes.

# Features:
-All features of Champollion minus parallel execution.
-Responsive U.I. after the call to start Champollion has started.
-An about and help buttons for assistance using this GUI.
